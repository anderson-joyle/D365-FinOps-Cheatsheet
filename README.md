Dynamics 365 AX/Op/FinOp cheatsheet knowledge you will frequently encounter in daily projects.

Kindly note that there are much that can improved. Since that there is no official documentation for add-ins and tons of DLLs available, very likely there are clever ways to use the resources.

> **Note:** This cheatsheet aims primarily D365 version and above. However, there are contents that might apply to AX 2012 as well.

:warning: **Kindly take a look at [issues](https://github.com/anderson-joyle/D365O-Addins/issues) page to be aware of known issues and future improvements.**

## Motivation
This document is a cheatsheet for Dynamics 365 AX/Op/FinOp you will frequently encounter in projects.

This guide is not intended to teach you X++ or D365 AX/Op/FinOp general development from the ground up, but to help developers with basic knowledge who may struggle to get familiar with some concepts.

Besides, I will sometimes provide personal tips that may be debatable but will take care to mention that it's a personal recommendation when I do so.

## Complementary Resources
When you struggle to understand a notion, I suggest you look for answers on the following resources:

- [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/) - Official Dynamics 365 AX/Op/FinOp documentation.
- [StackOverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dynamics-365-operations) - "dynamics-365-operations" tag on StackOverflow. Currently there is not that much content there, but this is a attempt to encourage you to use it when needed.
- [AX Community](https://community.dynamics.com/ax) - AX community where thousands of questions has been asked and answered.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - At the end, our best friend!
